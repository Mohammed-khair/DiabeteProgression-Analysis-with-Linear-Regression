# Diabetes Progression Analysis with Linear Regression

![Diabetes Progression Analysis](project_image.jpg)

## Description
This repository contains the code for the "Diabetes Progression Analysis with Linear Regression" project. The project aims to explore the relationship between diabetes progression and various patient features using the linear regression technique.

## Features
- Perform linear regression on individual patient features.
- Visualize scatter plots and regression lines for feature analysis.
- Calculate R-squared scores to assess the model's fit for each feature.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about patients with diabetes, including age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and more. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks
- Required Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-progression-analysis.git
   cd diabetes-progression-analysis
